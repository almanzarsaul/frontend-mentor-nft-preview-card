## My process

This was my first project using Frontend Mentor's PRO subscription. Having design file was extremely helpful and greatly increased my development speed. Having to build off of a .JPG was not very fun.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Figma design file
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flex
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to create an overlay on hover for an image.

### Continued development

In the future I would like to hone in on proper semantic HTML with a focus on accessibility and BEM CSS conventions.

### Useful resources

- [Josh W Comeau's CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - Great way to start from scratch without browser defaults.
- [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - Where I learned to create an overlay for images on hover.
